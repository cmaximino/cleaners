Data on behavioral and neurochemical aspects of cleanerfish-client interactions.

For the monoamines datasets, values represent samples from brain regions from individual fish (either cleaners or clients). Regarding context, CC means the conspecific context, CH the heterospecific, CCAQ the conspecific inside aquarium context, CHAQ the heterospecific inside aquarium, and Ctrl the control context. This information is also present on the metadata for each package.
Metadata was extracted and edited using the [datapackage-r package](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage-r).
